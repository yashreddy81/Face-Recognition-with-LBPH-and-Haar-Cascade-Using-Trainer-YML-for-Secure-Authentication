# Face-Recognition-with-LBPH-and-Haar-Cascade-Using-Trainer-YML-for-Secure-Authentication
Face recognition system using Haar Cascade for detection and LBPH for recognition. Integrated with a trained trainer.yml model for secure authentication. The project includes user image storage and database integration for seamless and secure login.

Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade for efficient face detection.
Face Recognition: Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH) for recognizing faces.
Secure Authentication: Verifies user identity based on stored images and a trained model (trainer.yml).
Database Integration: Stores user images and credentials for authentication.

requires:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MySQL (for database integration)
Create a database (bankdb) and a users table.
Insert user credentials (username, password, and image path).
you should create a database first
